/// Keeps the miner's shaft and its vanilla mineshaft out of the village's terrain adaptation.
///
/// `StructureWeightSampler` reads the adaptation from the structure *start*, not from the piece, so
/// pieces living inside a village start inherit `beard_thin`, which carves air above each piece box
/// and packs terrain below it. Underground that turns the mineshaft into one long cavern, leaving
/// only the plank floor and its rails.
///
/// `intersectsChunk` is the sampler's own filter and its only caller in the game, so returning false
/// means exactly "do not adapt terrain for this piece". Vanilla mineshafts declare no adaptation and
/// never reach the sampler, so they are unaffected either way.
